# Computational Complexity

## Computational Complexity
### Task 1
 * Calculate the computational complexity of this code segment.

```
1   for r ← 1 to m
2     for s ← 1 to n
3       count ← 0
4       for t ← 1 to k
5         if seq(r, s) = bases(t)
6           count ← count + 1
7       if count = 0
8         bases(k + 1) ← seq(r, s)
9         k ← k + 1
```

## Selection Sort
The following algorithm, called Selection Sort, is a naive but simple iterative 
method to solve the sorting problem. First, Selection sort finds the
smallest element in the list of integers, and moves it to the first position by swapping it with
whatever happens to be in the first position. Next, Selection sort
finds the second-smallest element in the list, and moves it to the second position,
again by swapping with value in the second position. At the *i*<sup>th</sup> iteration, Selection sort finds the *i*<sup>th</sup>
smallest element in the list, and moves it to the *i*<sup>th</sup> position.

### Task 2
 * In R, implement the function `IndexOfMin()` according to the following pseudocode.

 * Input:
   * list of integers
   * index of the first position
   * index of the last position

 * Output:
   * index of the smallest element of the list between first and last index

* Estimate the number of operations of this function, i.e., the computational complexity, depending on the input size. 

```
IndexOfMin(array, first, last)
1   index ← first
2   for k ← first + 1 to last
3     if array[k] < array[index]
4       index ← k
5   return index
```

### Task 3 
 * In R, implement the function `SelectionSort()` according to the following pseudocode.

 * Input:
   * list of integers
   * number of integers in the list

 * Output:
   * sorted list of integers

 * Estimate the number of operations of this function, i.e., the computational complexity, depending on the input size.
 * Determine the *O* notation.

```
SelectionSort(array, n)
1   for i ← 1 to n − 1
2     j ← IndexOfMin(array, i, n)
3     Swap elements array[i] and array[j]
4   return array
```

### Task 4
 * In R, implement the function `RecursiveSelectionSort()` according to the following pseudocode.

 * Input:
   * list of integers
   * index of the first position
   * index of the last position

 * Output:
   * sorted list of integers

 * Estimate the number of operations of this function, i.e., the computational complexity, depending on the input size.
 * Determine the *O* notation.
 * Decide which algorithm (`SelectionSort()` or `RecursiveSelectionSort()`) algorithm is more efficient.

```
RecursiveSelectionSort(array, first, last)
1   if first < last
2     index ← IndexOfMin(array, first, last)
3     Swap array[first] with array[index]
4     array ← RecursiveSelectionSort(array, first + 1, last)
5   return array
```
